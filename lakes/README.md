# data lakes project

## Rationale
A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database even more and want to move their data warehouse to a data lake. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

This project is to build an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, processes them using Spark, and loads the data back into S3 as a set of dimensional tables. This will allow their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to.

## Database design
### Fact Table
- songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
  - songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent
### Dimension Tables
- users - users in the app
  - user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
- songs - songs in music database
  - song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
- artists - artists in music database
  - artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
- time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
  - start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday

## ETL

### Log data import
User, time and songplay data is imported from line delimited json files in s3a://udacity-dend/log_data

- The json files are read into a data_frame
- A time df is created
    - For the time data this also involves the derivation of time features from the timestamp (day_of_week, month, etc)
- A user df is created
- The dfs are converted to temp tables and wrangled using spark sql

### Song and artist data import

Song and artist data is imported from json files s3a://udacity-dend/song_data

For each of song and artist
- The json files are read into a data_frame
- song and artist dataframs are created
- The dfs are converted to temp tables and wrangled using spark sql

### Songplay data
The songplay data is generated by joining the song and artist data using spark sql
- The song and artist data is joined using `song_select` and a dataframe created

## Export
The user, time, song, artist and songplay dataframes are written back to s3 as parquet files
Songs table files are partitioned by year and then artist. Time table files are partitioned by year and month. Songplays table files are partitioned by year and month.

## Project Repository files
- `lakes_final.py` - Code to read Sparkify song data and log data from the data directory and and read it into a a postgres database
